# Egal-Scout-Project
This is a database I built for my project in 2016

I was given the records to the only expatriate graveyard in Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately they hadn't been very well treated. The book that housed all of this information was about to fall apart so I decided to digitize all the records and put them into a database so those who wanted to visit their loved ones could find where they were buried. With the help of a surveyor I was able to survey the graveyard and take the positions of every grave with some of my fellow scouts. It was a long process but in the end we had a map of the graveyard with the position of every grave marked. I then took the book and transferred all of the data in it into an excel file which I then used to populate a database using microsoft access. If you wish to use the database you will need microsoft access on your computer. I have included photos of the process as well as pictures of the database for those interested.
